IND CNJ
    VII
        Only significant variable is that of Preverbs of time, which increase the likelihood of the Independent. Dont lnow why, cant come of with q reason lol 
    VAI
        Again, time increases the likelihood of the Ind, but there are now variables that increase the conj. Discourse preverbs were the most strongly affecting cnj, closely followed by obviative actors. Less strongly effecting a cnj form is the sg.actor effect. This image of the Conjunct as a form dealing with a preverb of discourse and a non-proximal actor suggest that the Conjunct is an order that is less 'basic'. (is more marked????)
    VTI
        Again the Conjunct has to do with discourse. verbs of action and verbs of monmey/counting also increased conjucnt. Place goals, nominalized goals, and body part goals similarly increased the likelihood of the Conjunct, as did the third person actors. Person actors and especially second person actor, as well as those with goals posessed by first persons. This suggests the Independent to be an order more related to local participants or those dependent on them.
    VTA
        verbs of food, preverbs of position, movement, and time all increased the likelihood of the Conjunct Order, as were obviative actors and goals. PErson goals and singular actor did as well. Only one effect was associated witht he Independent in the VTAs, that of first person actors. In this class, it seems the Conjunct order is, unlike in other cases, non-present in nature, as well as being modified by preverbs. Independent still associated with a local actor, but not second person. That Cnj is associated with obviative fits in with other classes.
    --------------------
    Different profilesx for different conjugation classes. VAI and VTI seem to have IND more close to the speaker, but dispolaced in time. VTA has the Conjucnt dispalced in time,. and shows similar, though less agressively, association betwen the ind and the sppeaker.



IND êCNJ
    VII 
        time again increase cnj
    
    VAI
        Discourse preverbs again increased the likelihood of an ê-Conjucnt, and time again the Independent. Both first person and third person actors increased the chance of obserbing an Indepsendent form, with first person being most strong.
    
    VTI 
        Similar to last alternation, but no body part goals apparent.

    VTA
        Similar to the last alternation, preverbs of position, discourse, movement, and time all increasedc the Conjunct, as do verbs dealing with food and obviative actors. Local actors had moderate to strong effects on increasing the likelihood of the Independent. This again creates a profile in which the Conjunct is less grounded in the speech act
----------------------------------------------
    Very similar to the above alternation. Interestingly, time behaves the same despite the issue of PV/ka being a component of time and having to do withthe Conjunct in General (as part of the ka-Conjunct in the Other-Conjunct), but isnt used at all in the ê-Conjunct (though other preverbs of time are, obviously).

CNJ type
    VII
        Weather was the only effect, and only for the kâ-Conjunct. In reality probably just too few tokens, as there were lots of insignificant effects
    VAI
        The likelyhood of an ê-Conjunct was increased strongly by preverbs of discourse and position, and more modertately by first person weak reduplication, first and third person actors, and actors of close relationships Singular actors have a moderate effect of decreasing the lik,elihood of a form occuring in the ê-Conjunct.
        
        Singular actors, plural actors, and actors representing people all moderately increased the likelihood of a kâ-Conjunct, while preverbs of desire and ability, position, and discourse strongly increased this likel.ihood. Third and first person actors as well as verbs of cooking decreased the likelihood of an kâ-Conjunct more moderately.
        
        The Other-Conjunct had fewer effects, but generally much stronger than the ones previously discussed. Second person actors, preverbs of desire and ability, and verbs of health strongly increased the likelihood for this outcome, while preverbs of quality and actors of close relations strongly decreased this likelihood, especially the latter. 
    VTI
        The majority of the significant ê-Conjunct effects decreased the outcome's likelihood. Second person actors, proximal goals, preverbs of desire and ability, verbs of speech, and nominalized actors were strong negative effects, while a singular goal was only moderately negative. 

        Conversely, the majority of the significant effects for the kâ-Conjunct increased the likelihood of an outcome. The strongest positive effects were those preverbs of desire and ability, proximate goals, verbs of speech, and actors representing people. The only negative effect was the strong preverbs of position.  

        For the Other Conjunct, second person actors, medial goals, and nominalized goals strong increasxed the likelihood of an Other-Conjunct. The only negative effects were strong effects of position and goals representing inanimate objects.  
    VTA
        For VTAs, preverbs of discourse and position had strong positive effects on the ê-Conjunct, with goals posessed by singular first persons and those with first person actors providing more moderate effects. Second person and generally proximate actors strongly decreased the likelihood of the ê-Conjunct, while singular goals provided a moderate negative effect. 

        The kâ-Conjunct outcome had only four significant effects: proximate actors and signular goals increased the ikelihood of this outcomes, while preverbs of position and verbs of cognition decreased it.

        Similarly, the Other-Conjunct has 4 significant effects: second person actors shows a strong effect and verbs of cognition did so in a more moderate ways. Preverbs of discourse was a very strong negative effect, while first person actors provided a stills trong, but more moderate effect.
